Deploying simple OpenStack env. In this example `orchestration` engine is NOT used. 

You need to run it from main solar directory. To deploy run:

`python examples/openstack/openstack.py deploy`

To clean nodes, run:

`python examples/openstack/openstack.py undeploy`


#### Currently this example does not use solar orchestration. We will change it in near future. For now just don't run `solar orch` or `solar changes` stuff with this example.
